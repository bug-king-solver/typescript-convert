## About the task

1. How much time it took to complete?

   I think it takes about 20 minutes to complete codes.

2. Your overall thoughts on the excerice.

   The challenge is a typical coding challenge that requires me to create a data conversion function based on given internal and external data types. It's a relevant task that simulates real-world scenarios, testing my ability to work with data structures, manipulate them, and perform type conversions.

3. Identify what is lacking in the task definition.

   The task lacks a description of the expected behavior of the conversion. Specifically, it doesn't mention whether any transformations need to be applied to the data during the conversion.

   The task doesn't provide clear instructions on what to do with the placeholder timestamp values (seconds and nanos). It should specify how these values should be populated.

4. Whether the solution is complete? Whether it is optimized or solved through brute force?

   Solution Completeness:

   The solution provided covers the basic requirements of converting data from internal types to external types. It includes the conversion of the entire data structure and demonstrates how to use the provided data types and structures to achieve the conversion.

   Optimization vs. Brute Force:

   The solution provided is more optimized than brute force. It uses a combination of data transformation and mapping functions to perform the conversion. However, the solution doesn't involve any complex algorithms or processing, as the data structures are relatively simple.

5. Be sure that your code is readable and well commented or that the naming is semantic.

   The code is well-organized and follows a clear structure. Variable and function names are semantic and meaningful, enhancing code readability. The comments explain important sections and clarify placeholders that need actual data.
